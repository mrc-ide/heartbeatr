If you run a long running calculation on a remote machine your calculation can fail if the machine falls over, the network goes down, or your code crashes R.  This package provides a "heartbeat" service that uses Redis to periodically prevent a key from expiring, forming a [dead man's switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch).  You can then monitor the key to detect failure in your process and re-queue/rerun/investigate as appropriate.

## Usage

```r
f <- function() {
  h <- heartbeatr::heartbeat("mykey", 4)
  # ... long running job here
  # h$stop() # optional - will stop automatically once h is garbage collected
}
```

## Installation

``` r
drat:::add("mrc-ide")
install.packges("heartbeatr")
```

It is also possible to install directly from GitHub using `remotes` as

``` r
remotes::install_gituhb("mrc-ide/heartbeatr", ugprade = FALSE)
```
