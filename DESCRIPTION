Description: Simple heartbeat support for R using 'Redis'. A heartbeat
    is a background thread that acts as a dead-man's switch. It will
    create a key on Redis that will automatically expire after a
    number of seconds and then periodically refresh that key, even
    when the R process is busy. If the process dies for some reason,
    then the key will disappear. A heartbeat can be used to detect
    loss of worker processes on shared systems.
